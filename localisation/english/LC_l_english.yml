 # Flavor Text
 #############################
 START_SCREEN_CTHULHU: "On this planet of space-age intelligent life-forms, Cthulhu, dead and dreaming, awakes.\n\nWithin hours, the oceans boil. The mentally insane are twisted into blashemic monstrosities, and normal individuals turn to repeatedly attempt suicide over and over again. Within days, as billions lose their sanity, things from graves return to life deformed and muttering ancient words and syllables. Tentacles sprout from the ground, and all they touch are twisted in their influence. Within a week, millions die as the species turns upon itself in its hunger and delerium. \n\nAs the last of the species transforms into a froathing pool of slime, the non-euclidean architecture of the Great Old Ones rises from the crust of the world and the Star-Spawn rise from the spires."
 
 START_SCREEN_HASTUR: "From distant, long-dead stars, ripples of violence feed a current in a hidden infinity that is uniquely belonging to old gods. On this occasion, it is the extinction of a vast peaceful civilization transformed into mad cannibals by a weaponized disease. Mangled bodies litter a dozen crumbling worlds. Innocents leap from the tallest spires to meet their landing in the afterlife. Children are ravenously devoured in their beds by their own mothers.These streams of violence flow into entropy personified. This violence now births the Great Old One Hastur's children like a great retching upon the surface of Carcosa. The blood-curdling cries of the space-faring monsters, the Byakhee, reverberate in the air as a new Yellow King is crowned to spread The Yellow Sign."

 START_SCREEN_DAGON: "Governments of Earth ceaselessly plundered underwater cities and slaughtered the Deep Ones. For centuries their kind had bided their time. Given to their own devices, humans were to destroy themselves.Then that inhuman, defeaning, world-ending crack dyed the world with indigo pools that crashed and swathed over man and monster alike. Countless frantic voices called out as bodies crunched under the weight of unfathomable waves. The last human being's lungs flooded. Alien silence reigned. Black skies stormed. Land vanished. The void below thrived with kingdoms most foul.Father Dagon does not rise, but the world of dead men falls beneath him. The age of the Deep Ones has begun."
 
 START_SCREEN_ELDERTHING: "Visions of stone cities scattered to ruin fill the exhibition hall in the old museum. Reflecting upon the past, the Elder Things' numerous appendages hang solemnly in mourning on a day of rememberence. Never again would they attempt to mold life from inorganic matter so carelessly as they had with the shoggoths. Framed poetry depicted how colonization of other worlds through solar sailing had failed as the shoggoths consumed scientists.Carved statues familiarize the visitors with the The Great Resurgence. A massive model of a sort of hole boring technology that pierced the ether looms above. A portrait with a grand epic-quality depicts the few survivors bursting through a cosmic portal only to gape in awe at a new three-sunned skyline. Your ruler paces in the museum with his barrel-shaped consorts, contempating the future of his species."

 START_SCREEN_YITH: "A deluge of amnesia has recently washed the collective minds of the Yith, leaving a large gap of memory between the Polyp Wars and the Great Migration. How the councils cleared the path to the new world will forever remain a mystery to the common Yith.What is clear, however, is the severe limitation of powers that has come with these recent events. The ability to possess other minds has become limited and clunky. As researchers frantically search for the root of the problem, the Great Race of Yith faces its greatest challenge yet -- survival."


 START_SCREEN_NYARLATHOTEP: "After losing so many to the great line that followed in the wake of Nyarlathotep, witchhunts ensued to destroy the great pharoah. Upon losing one of his avatars to the machinations of the native species, Nyarlathotep rose up from its own ruin a returned deity.Bored of the creatures that inhabited the world, within the hour Nyarlathotep summoned the hunting horrors from across time and space. Teeth, wings, and serpentine fury tore into the innocents and guilty alike -- tearing the world's population asunder."
 
 
 START_SCREEN_YOGSOTHOTH: "The Shoggoths had toiled tirelessly after achieving independence from their creators, and through their many-limbed protoplasmic spantaneous organ-spawning forms, they also freed the last endevour of their founding species -- an imprisoned summoned Avatar of Yog-Sothoth. Upon its arrival, the form of Yog-Sothoth so resembled the Shoggoths that they took Yog-Sothoth as their personal savior for the times to come. Yog-Sothoth welcomed them to the Gate. The Shoggoths understood that Yog-Sothoth was the Key to all things."

 START_SCREEN_MIGO: "Outwardly, the MiGo appear unknowable. Through otherwordly matter, they permeate into this galaxy and can, through great strain, modify their own coporeal structure to inhabit many worlds. As a ruler of this galactic colony, you understand the great purpose. Your species is but a small branch of the great outer dimensional empire. Prove your worth by exploiting the species of this galaxy. Their biology, minerals, and knowledge must be collected for the masters. Go forth and take sovereignty in their name."

 cosmichorror.3.desc.1: "A necromancer's recent acquisition of a mummified alien carcass revealed a strange discovery. Upon reanimating the mummy, the necromancer was pulverized into paste. By means of blood and entrails, a most unnatural map of the stars was painted across formerly blank walls. Upon its discovery by local enforcers, the pharaohic being attempted to kill again, but was permanently silenced. The starmap remains. Upon laying hands on the blood starmap, cult leaders feel the presence of dreamlands and strange musical instruments. They believe that perhaps this is the fabled pilgrimage to Kadeth -- and -- to Azathoth."
 cosmichorror.3.desc.2: "A museum curator's recent acquisition of a mummified alien carcass revealed a strange discovery. Upon successfully deciphering aloud an inscription upon its sarcophagus, the curator was astonished at the mummy's sudden reanimation, and then equally as astonished as he was pulverized into paste. By means of blood and entrails, a most unnatural map of the stars was painted across formerly clean museum walls. Upon its discovery by local law enforcement, the pharaohic being attempted to kill again, but was permanently silenced. The starmap remains with a bloody eye at its heart -- still dripping with ichor of an innocent."

Within minutes, a looming open eye seeps into the vision of all species as if burned onto their retinas with a hot branding iron used on cattle designated for slaughter. In the following hours, from the center of the galaxy a thick noxious tidal wave of extradimensional entropy manifests as colossal claws that begin to grope, pierce, and crush celestial objects as if they were glass ornaments. On the outer rim, spindly appendages the size of dozens of systems inhale entire worlds into gnashing mandibles with consuming force resembling the most powerful of only theorized black holes. The Old Ones and Outer Gods have fled this plane of existence. It is only a matter of time until the end. As many turn to scream in horror, no sounds can come. All vibrations across space have ceased at the coming of Azathoth Awakened."

The color itself is neither gas nor plasma and seemingly escapes most testing as if it is not part of the same plane of existence as ourselves.\n\nWhen a color is exposed to a natural environment, it causes seemingly positive mutagenic properties.

 story.1.desc.oldone: "The microscopic lifeforms sprout wings, grow luminous eyes, and then suddenly shrivel and burn as [Root.GetLeaderName] glares with the intensity of a star at the insignificant form of life. [Root.GetName] have begun to see simplistic organisms in extraterrestrial studies, however, the Old One among them creates an aura that makes all species, including [Root.GetName] feel equally as infinitely insignificant for such small studies."

# story.2.oldone_name: "Contact Report: Deep Space Dwellers"
 story.2.desc.oldone: "From the abyss, other species call out in the vacuum of deep space. [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] senses their vitae churning in alien carapaces, and upon gazing at their ability to sail through the cosmos, [Root.GetRulerName] recalls a memory of flying through the stars, and with that memory several of your species have grown solar sailing wings and their lungs have twisted into extraterrestrial organs capable of unfathomable processes. "
 story.2.desc.oldone.followup: "When your solar sailors attempted to fly into space, they had done so at their own peril. Their glassed remains now orbit the skies of [Root.Capital.GetName] at night. [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] has forgotten them. Despite this dark turn, the following night, their remains had attracted the space dwellers, and [Root.GetName] tranquilized and apprehended \"living\" specimens for research as the cracked glass eyes of their once-kin drifted aimlessly amongst the stars."

story.3.desc.oldone.followup: "Following previous reports on alien life, [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] xeno-biologists are pleased to learn to complex life forms that appear not too different from what we would find on [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe beings still defy easy classification and hardly possess anything more than purely animal instincts, but their existence does indicate that some patterns of life are indeed universal."

story.4.oldone_name: "Contact Report: Pre-Sentient Beings"
story.4.desc.oldone: "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the alien beings encountered by the [From.GetName] some time ago.\n\nTheir near-intelligence is fascinating, and it is sobering to realize that while the [Root.GetName] may only just have made its entrance on the galactic stage, we have already come a long way."
story.4.desc.oldone.followup: "Following previous discoveries of lower forms of life, the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] capital receives news of the [From.GetFleetName]'s observations of beings with impressive, if latent, cognitive capabilities and great evolutionary potential.\n\nScience Officer [From.GetLeaderName]'s report is received with marked enthusiasm."

story.5.oldone_name: "Contact Report: Remnants"
story.5.desc.oldone: "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the alien remnants studied by the [From.GetFleetName].\n\nThese leavings are considered definitive proof of intelligent, purposeful alien activity at some point in the past - we may still be alone now, but we are at least not the first to be so."
story.5.desc.oldone.followup: ""Intelligent life taunts with pointed absence" reads a popular newsnet post on [Root.Capital.GetName]. The people of the [Root.GetName] are apparently finding some humor in the fact that lower forms of alien life are now a matter of public record, but potential equals from other stars continue to elude us.\n\nScience Officer [From.GetLeaderName]'s report on the traces found on [From.From.GetName] seemingly only add an ironic twist to the situation."

story.6.desc.oldone: "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the primitive alien civilization found by our fleets.\n\nThey may not be capable of space-flight, but the aliens of the [From.From.GetName] are quantifiably intelligent and their society shows all the hallmarks of a moderately advanced culture."
story.6.desc.oldone.followup5: "The scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName] is excited to receive the report on intelligent alien life.\n\nThey may not be capable of space-flight, but the aliens of the [From.From.GetName] are quantifiably intelligent and their society shows all the hallmarks of a moderately advanced culture. Prominent xenologists note that this is an excellent opportunity to study a society perhaps not unlike the ones we have previously only found ancient remains of."
story.6.desc.oldone.followup4: "The report on a primitive culture is welcomed by [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] researchers, following previous discoveries relating to pre-sentient species.\n\nAs far as we are aware the [Root.GetName] is the first civilization to take to the stars, but it is fascinating to learn that some other cultures may only be a few millennia, or possibly even centuries, behind."
story.6.desc.oldone.followup123: "Effectively capping off previous discoveries of lower forms of life, the report on the primitive aliens, the [From.From.GetName], encountered by our fleets has reignited interest in the xenological sciences on [Root.Capital.GetName], previously considered a largely theoretical field."

These are the first mortals to meet the [Root.GetName]. Yet [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] looms over all in dreams to come."
 story.7.desc.oldonefollowup6: "Cancerous intelligence streaks across stars that belong only to [Root.GetName].\n\n. Shadows gather around [Root.Capital.GetName]. Saliva drools from puss-ridden terrors. [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] worshippers prepare their heinous instruments in anticipation of sacrifices to come."
 story.7.desc.oldonefollowup12345: "At once, a strong vision floods our people with streams of colors and vibrations of a foreign starship with sophisticated engines wailing on foreign worlds.
