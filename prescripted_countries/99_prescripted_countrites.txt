The mentally insane are twisted into blashemic monstrosities, and normal individuals turn to repeatedly attempt suicide over and over again. Within days, as billions lose their sanity, things from graves return to life deformed and muttering ancient words and syllables. Tentacles sprout from the ground, and all they touch are twisted in their influence. Within a week, millions die as the species turns upon itself in its hunger and delerium. As the last of the species transforms into a froathing pool of slime, the non-euclidean architecture of the Great Old Ones rises from the crust of the world and the Star-Spawn rise from the spires."

Innocents leap from the tallest spires to meet their landing in the afterlife.

This violence now births the Great Old One Hastur's children like a great retching upon the surface of Carcosa.

Framed poetry depicted how colonization of other worlds through solar sailing had failed as the shoggoths consumed scientists.Carved statues familiarize the visitors with the The Great Resurgence. A massive model of a sort of hole boring technology that pierced the ether looms above. A portrait with a grand epic-quality depicts the few survivors bursting through a cosmic portal only to gape in awe at a new three-sunned skyline. Your ruler paces in the museum with his barrel-shaped consorts, contempating the future of his species."
